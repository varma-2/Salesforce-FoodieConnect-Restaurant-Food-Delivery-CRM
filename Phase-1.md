# Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
**Project:** FoodieConnect – Restaurant & Food Delivery CRM

---

## 1. Problem Statement
In today’s fast-growing food delivery industry, customers expect quick service, personalized offers, and real-time updates. However, many restaurant partners and delivery businesses face challenges such as:

1. Maintaining an updated record of menus, offers, and partners.  
2. Tracking customer orders and delivery schedules manually, which leads to delays.  
3. Lack of a structured loyalty system to retain customers.  
4. Limited visibility into sales patterns, delivery time efficiency, and top-selling dishes.

FoodieConnect aims to resolve these issues by implementing a Salesforce CRM solution that centralizes operations. The system will allow restaurants to manage menus and offers, enable real-time order tracking for customers, automate delivery scheduling, and provide managers with actionable dashboards.

## 2. Requirement Gathering
**Core requirements identified:**

- Onboard and manage restaurant partners with menus and promotional offers.  
- Enable customers to place orders and track delivery status in real time.

## 3. Stakeholder Analysis
- **Restaurant Owners:** Need an easy interface to update menus, prices, and offers; visibility into incoming orders.  
- **Delivery Agents:** Need assignment notifications, route/ETA details, and status update capability.  
- **Customers:** Expect seamless ordering, timely updates (SMS/Email/Push), and loyalty benefits.  
- **Managers/Admins:** Require dashboards and reports to monitor KPIs like average delivery time, revenue by restaurant/dish, and customer retention.

## 4. Business Process Mapping
**Proposed process flow:**

1. Customer browses available restaurants and menus, then places an order.  
2. Restaurant receives order, confirms preparation, and updates order status.  
3. Delivery agent is assigned (automatic or manual) based on location/availability.  
4. Customer receives order tracking updates; upon delivery, loyalty points are credited.  
5. Managers review dashboards and reports to identify trends and improvement areas.

This automated process replaces manual phone-based tracking and spreadsheet reliance, reducing errors and improving speed.
