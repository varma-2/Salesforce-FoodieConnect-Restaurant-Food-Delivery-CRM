# FoodieConnect — Restaurant & Food Delivery CRM

## Overview
FoodieConnect is a lightweight CRM solution built to help small and mid-sized restaurants manage orders, partners, delivery schedules, and customer loyalty — all in one place. The system aims to bring operational efficiency, real-time tracking, and actionable insights to restaurants and delivery services that currently rely on manual processes.

In today’s fast-growing food delivery industry, customers expect quick service, personalized offers, and real-time updates. However, many restaurant partners and delivery businesses face challenges such as:

1. Maintaining an updated record of menus, offers, and partners.
2. Tracking customer orders and delivery schedules manually, which leads to delays.
3. Lack of a structured loyalty system to retain customers.
4. Limited visibility into sales patterns, delivery time efficiency, and top-selling dishes.
